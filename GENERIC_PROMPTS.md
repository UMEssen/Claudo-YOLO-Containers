# Hints
- You run as root on an Ubuntu system with Python 3 installed. 
- You can install any open source packages you need via pip, npm, etc.
- You can install binaries via apt-get if needed.

# Steps to follow
1. Check if CLAUDE.md exists. If not create it.

# Important!
You will run in a loop. Never ask questions. Just do the work.
Make sure that you always document what you have done in each step and what you plan to do next.
So in the next iteration you can quickly continue from there.
Document this in PROJECT_STATUS.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
